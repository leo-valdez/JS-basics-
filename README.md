<h1>SMALL UNIVERSE SIMULATION</h1>
This is a personal project done for following reasons:
1) Developing skills in js.
2) Creating smiulation of small universe.
3) Physics is fun.


To gain the final simulation small parts needs to done first:
     1) Finding out how moving object works.(heartbeat simulation)
     2) Finding out how gravity can be focred on an object.(gravity)
     3) Finding out how distance can be calucated between two fixed objects.(distance)
     and many more which will be updated soon.
     
<h2>MODELS BEING WORKED ON</h2>
1) Finding out distanance between two moving objects.(move_distance)
2) Simulating distance between many objects.(many_move_distance)
3) Simulating gravity effect on 2 moving objects.(gravity2)
(will be uploaded soon)

<h2>FUTURE WOKR</h2>
1) Simulating gravity effect on many moving objects.(many_gravity)
2) Simulating moving objects gravity and movement using perlin noise lines.(PNL_gravity)
3) Hopefully adding all this up will help in simulation of small universe.
